I am Jorge and welcome to my personal page.

I am Full Stack Developer focused on web applications. In my career I have used several technologies to build web apps such as Java, PHP, Laravel, Bootstrap, Bulma, Javascript, Vue.js, React, Angular and much more. I use my spare time to learn new technologies and build useful things for myself and for people in general. I have also some interest in Mobile Development.

Besides my life as a Developer, I also have background with Machine Learning and Data Science, using Python along with Keras and TensorFlow. I have worked on a few projects and have special ability with Facial Expression Recognition (FER).
